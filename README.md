# iPOS - Retail POS

React + Vite + Tailwind CSS with Supabase Auth and company-scoped RLS. Includes POS, products/costs, suppliers/purchases, quotations, receipts, cashbook, reports, returns, shifts, stock adjustments, staff management and audit history.

## Run

`npm install`, then `npm run dev`. Build: `npm run build`. Tests: `npm test`.

## Vercel

Import this repository. Framework: **Vite**. Build command: `npm run build`. Output: `dist`. `vercel.json` supports direct React Router URLs. Configure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` for production/preview. Existing `.env.production` contains only public Supabase configuration. Never expose service-role/secret keys.

After deployment, configure Supabase Auth Site URL and `/login` and `/reset-password` redirect URLs for the new origin. The staff invitation Edge Function currently targets the original hosted site; update its allowed origin and redirect once the new deployment URL is verified. Custom SMTP is needed for reliable employee email delivery.

## Daily workflow

Open a cashier shift before checkout. Optional customer name/phone appear on receipts. Supervisors/directors approve refunds, record externally handled payouts and optionally restore stock. Receipt settings include company logo, contacts, footer, return policy and paper width. Company logos are separate from official iPOS branding. Staff join through invitations; directors can change operational roles or disable access.

## Database

SQL under `supabase/` records the reference schema and additive changes already applied to the connected project. **Do not rerun every file against that database.** For a different project, review dependencies and apply in order. Local database verification fixtures, build output and credentials are excluded from this repository. Edge Function secrets belong in its server runtime.

Refunds preserve original sales, allocate discounts/tax at cent precision, reject excess quantities and support idempotent retry. Drawer transfers are separate from business income/expense. P&L depends on recorded costs and opening balances; balance reconciliation checks arithmetic rather than accounting completeness.

Local tax invoices/refund receipts are not submitted to ZRA or certified fiscal documents. Bank/mobile-money transfers are recorded, not sent by this app.

## Verification

Production build and 23 unit tests passed. Rollback live database checks verified checkout/retries, mixed payment/change, partial/full refunds/restocking, adjustment limits, quotation conversion, shift reconciliation, audit and role/company restrictions. Browser/device, actual email activation/inbox delivery, concurrent checkout sessions and physical printer/scanner checks remain before an operational pilot.

## Email verification links

Sign-up confirmation emails open an iPOS page instead of a Supabase address, using the same link structure as MongoDB Atlas:

`https://ipossystem.vercel.app/account/email/verify?token_hash=…&type=signup&n=%2Faccount%2Fregister%2Fsuccess&username=owner%40store.com`

| Part | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `/account/email/verify` | iPOS confirmation page (asks for one tap, so email scanners can't use up the link) |
| `token_hash` | one-time secret from Supabase; removed from the address bar after the page opens |
| `type` | `signup`, `invite`, `recovery`, `email_change` or `magiclink` |
| `n` | iPOS page to open after confirming; links to other websites are refused |
| `username` | the email address being confirmed (display only) |

After confirming, new directors land on `/account/register/success`, which waits for the company workspace to be created. Expired links offer "Send a new link".

**Setup in Supabase (one time):**
1. Authentication → Emails → **Confirm signup**: subject `Confirm your email for iPOS`, body = `supabase/email-templates/confirm-signup.html`.
2. Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs: add `https://ipossystem.vercel.app/**`.

Until the template is changed, the default Supabase link still works: it now returns to `/account/register/success`.

## WhatsApp / SMS receipts and the offers list

Every receipt has **Send receipt to phone**: type or confirm the customer's number and tap **WhatsApp** or **SMS**. The message opens on the shop's own phone with the receipt filled in; one more tap sends it. No paid service is used.

- Numbers are normalised to Zambia by default (`0977 123 456`, `977123456`, `+260…` are the same customer).
- Sending saves the number as a customer and links the sale (`record_receipt_share`, `supabase/receipt-sharing.sql`, applied).
- Customers join the **offers list** only when staff tick that they agreed (Data Protection Act 2021). Date and staff member are recorded; opting out is on the Customers page.
- Customers → **Offers list** exports only customers who agreed (CSV, spreadsheet-safe).
- Automatic sending without a tap needs a paid WhatsApp Business API or SMS provider; not included.

## Reorder list

**Reorder List** (directors and supervisors) shows what to restock: out of stock, at/below the low-stock level, or under a week left at the last 30 days' sales speed.

- Suggested quantity = enough for 1 week / 2 weeks / 1 month of sales + the low-stock level − stock − quantities already on open purchase orders.
- Supplier and unit cost default to the product's most recent purchase (else the saved product cost); all editable.
- Lines are grouped by supplier; **Create purchase order** makes one order per supplier with the existing `create_purchase` function (retry-safe), then **Send to supplier** opens WhatsApp with the order.
- Receive deliveries in Suppliers & Purchases as before. No database changes.

## Branches

One product list and one set of prices; **stock is kept per branch**. Database: `supabase/branches.sql` (applied).

- Every stock change already writes a `stock_movements` row; a trigger applies it to the right branch in `branch_stock` and stops a branch going below zero. `products.stock_quantity` stays the company total (stock in transit is not counted).
- Which branch: sales → the cashier's open shift; refunds → the sale's branch; purchase deliveries → the order's branch; other actions → the branch chosen in the app (`*_at` functions), else the user's home branch, else the main branch.
- Existing stock, sales, shifts, adjustments and purchase orders were assigned to **Main shop**. Cashiers and supervisors start at Main shop; directors see all branches.
- **Staff:** cashiers belong to one branch; directors and supervisors can be given one branch or all (Branches → Who works where).
- **Branch picker** in the top bar for people with all-branch access. Dashboard, products, sales, shifts, stock adjustments, purchase orders and the reorder list follow it. Checkout, shifts, adjustments and the reorder list need one branch.
- **Transfers:** send (stock leaves the sending branch, shown as in transit) → receive (counted on arrival; shortfalls need a note and are recorded) or cancel (stock returns).
- **Branches page:** combined view per branch (today, 7 days, stock units/value, low/out of stock, open shifts, staff, transfers) and branch management (directors).

## Expiry dates

Expiry dates are optional and can be entered when receiving a delivery, adding stock, creating a product, or afterwards for stock already on the shelf (Expiry Dates → "Add dates to shelf stock").

- Dated stock is kept in `stock_batches` (per branch). Stock without a date is counted as sold first; after that the batch that expires soonest is used first.
- Transfers carry their expiry dates to the receiving branch, and a cancelled transfer returns them.
- The **Expiry Dates** page (directors and supervisors) groups batches into Expired, Within 7 days, Within 30 days and Later, with a one-tap write-off. The dashboard shows an alert, and checkout marks products that have expired stock.
- Database: `supabase/expiry-variants.sql`.

## Product variants (sizes, colours)

Products → "Add with sizes / colours" builds every combination of up to two options (e.g. Colour × Size), each with its own SKU, barcode, price and stock. "+ Variant" adds more to an existing product, or turns a single product into variants.

Each variant is an ordinary product (so stock, reports, branches and barcodes work unchanged), linked by `variant_group_id`. Checkout shows one card per product and opens a picker for the variant.

## Setup guide

New owners see a **setup guide** at the top of the dashboard: shop details, products, suppliers, staff, branches, first shift, a test sale and installing the app. Each step ticks itself off from the shop's real data; optional steps can be skipped ("I work alone", "I have one shop"). The guide can be hidden and is always available under **Getting Started & Help**. Supervisors and cashiers see only the steps that apply to them. Logic: `src/setup-utils.js`; component: `src/SetupGuide.jsx`.

## Languages (Bemba and Nyanja)

Cashier screens (checkout, choosing a size/colour, customer and credit at checkout, receipts list, shifts, offline messages, pop-ups and the menu) can be shown in **English, Ichibemba or Chinyanja**. Each person picks their language from the selector at the top of the menu or on My Profile; it is remembered on the device (works offline) and on their account.

All wording is in `src/i18n.js`: English is the key and each entry has `[Bemba, Nyanja]`. To correct a translation, edit the text there; anything missing falls back to English. Receipts, invoices and reports stay in English. `tests/i18n.test.js` checks that every translated text on screen has both languages with matching `{placeholders}`.

## Checks (mistake & fraud flags)

Directors get a **Checks** page (Management → Checks) and a dashboard notice when something needs a second look: drawers short or over at close, the same cashier short repeatedly, refunds soon after or long after a sale, many refunds on one cashier's sales, big discounts, items sold well below their price, late-night sales, stock repeatedly adjusted out as missing/damaged, and large cash withdrawals. A flag is a reason to look, not proof of wrongdoing.

Each flag can be marked **Looks fine** (with a note) or **Looking into it**, and reopened. Rules and thresholds live in `src/flag-utils.js` (`RULES`); decisions are stored in `flag_reviews` (`supabase/flag-reviews.sql`), readable and writable by directors only.

## Business assistant

Directors and supervisors get a **daily summary** on the dashboard (yesterday vs the same day last week, best seller, today so far, out-of-stock and low stock, expiring stock, money owed on credit) and a **Business assistant** page with plain answers to: how did we do this week, what sells best, what makes the most profit, what isn't selling, what to reorder, when we are busiest, how customers pay, who owes money, which cashier sells most, and how branches compare. Typed questions are matched to the closest of these.

Everything is worked out in the app from the shop's own data (`src/assistant-utils.js`); no AI service or outside account is used. Supervisors don't see profit or cashier comparisons.

## Dark mode

Each device can use **Light**, **Dark** or **Match this device** (sidebar button, or My Profile → Appearance). The choice is stored on the device and applied before the page draws, so there is no white flash.

`src/dark.css` is generated from `src/style.css` by `scripts/make-dark-css.py` (needs `pip install tinycss2`): every rule that sets a colour is repeated for dark mode with light surfaces turned dark and dark text turned light; green buttons, the toasts and other dark/brand surfaces keep their colours; receipts keep their white paper look and printing is unaffected. **After changing colours in style.css, run `python3 scripts/make-dark-css.py`.**

## Smart reordering and the home dashboard

**Run-out forecast** (`src/forecast-utils.js`): each product's selling speed blends the last 7 days with the whole period (recent days count more), so a product that suddenly sells faster is caught early. From it: days of stock left, the run-out date, an "order by" date (2 days for delivery), and a suggested quantity for the chosen cover period minus anything already on order. Shown as sentences on the Reorder list ("You'll run out of Sugar 2kg in about 4 days (Tue 20 Oct). Order 55 by Sun 18 Oct") and as a compact card on the dashboard. The Reorder list's suggested quantities use the same speed.

**Home dashboard**: four tiles with small trend lines (today's sales and number of sales vs the same day last week, average sale, items running out), this week against last week as a chart, the run-out card, best sellers, sales by hour today against a usual day, and how customers pay as a ring chart. Each chart keeps a table or text alternative for screen readers.

## Creator console (separate site)

The iPOS creator has a private console at **ipos-creator.vercel.app** (source in `creator/`, its own Vercel project). It shows crashes, visits on a world map (country and city from the connection, never GPS), who is online / away / offline (and offline sales waiting to sync), every shop and account with email-verification status, sign-ups per day, and feedback.

iPOS feeds it in the background (`src/telemetry.js` → `api/track.js`, which adds the approximate location from Vercel's connection headers): one visit per app load, crashes (window errors, unhandled promises and React render errors), and a heartbeat every minute while iPOS is open. Nothing is sent in development. Staff can send feedback from the sidebar. The privacy note is on the Help page. Database: `supabase/creator-console.sql` - reports go to tables with no read access for shops; only the allow-listed creator can read them through `creator_*` functions.

## Spreadsheet-style accounting

- **Profit & Loss** and **Balance Sheet** are laid out like accounting statements for any period (presets: this month, last month, quarter, year, last 30 days), with a comparison column (previous period or same period last year) and the change. Logic in `src/statements.js` (unit tested). Past balance sheets are rebuilt from today's figures by undoing later sales, deliveries, stock movements and customer payments.
- **Excel downloads** (`src/xlsx-export.js`, ExcelJS loaded only when downloading and not stored for offline use): any report or all reports in one workbook (a sheet each), and the cashbook (with a Daily totals sheet). Money formats, frozen headers, filters and `SUBTOTAL` totals. CSV is still available.
- **Cashbook** is a running-balance ledger: opening balance, money in / out / balance per row, optional daily subtotals, totals and closing balance. New entries are typed into the last row (Enter saves). Entries can't be edited; **Reverse** records the opposite entry ("Reversal of …"), which the P&L nets off against the original category. Owner capital, loans and drawings are kept out of profit.
- **Costs & opening balances** is an editable grid: unit costs with live margin and stock value, Enter/↓ to move down, paste a column from Excel, "fill blanks from product costs" for past sales.
